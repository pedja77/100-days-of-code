# 100 Days Of Code - Log

**Today's Progress**: Started work on FCC Portfolio challenge.

**Thoughts:** CSS drives me crazy, but step by step I'm getting it. Made html
skeleton and started work on responsive navigation bar.

**Extra:** Solved 3 elementary java script missions on [ckeckio](https://js.checkio.org).


### Day 3: January 5th, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Get stuck with portfolio project. Solved several JavaScript
tasks on [checkio](https://js.checkio.org). Did some research for FCC RandomQuoteMachine
and tested some JS snippets, just to get feel of what it will be like.

**Thoughts:** CSS damn you!!! :scream: . After second branching, considering the third,
possible will leave ambition to write vanilla css (for now) and roll back to Bootstrap.
Just to make my life easier for a while.


### Day 4: January 8th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Started work on Random quote machine. All day tweaking node
script which makes JS object fro several unix fortune files. Script, together with
fortunes is in resources directory in my repo. Made basic page,shows random quote
on refresh. No styles yet.

**Thoughts:** I really enjoyed todays "work", after two days pause. I'm guilty
for having some social life :smirk: .

### Day 5 & 6: January 9th & 10th, 2017

**Today's Progress:** Almost done with Random Quote Machine. I call it Random Fortune
Generator. I made it as possible as I can to mimic unix fortune program for terminal.
Last two days were spent on implementing console like behavior and small set of
"terminal" commands.

**Thoughts:** Feel fabulous.
